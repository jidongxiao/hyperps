~/jidong/hyperps$ ./bin/main -o freebsd dump.4g.free61 dump.4g.free61 
Okay, so we are dealing with FreeBSD 8.x operating system dump.
project kick-off!
==================Get Process Offset from the Trusted OS=======================
===We need a second pass to get the offsets.===
So the address for the first process's name is: 0xc042ddf1
So the address for the first process's name is: 0xc08a3598
So the address for the second process's name is: 0xc08a3593
So the address for the first process's name is: 0xc0a3f07a
So the address for the second process's name is: 0xc0a3f2bc
So the address for the first process's name is: 0xc0a796e3
So the address for the first process's name is: 0xc4aa6394
So the address for the second process's name is: 0xc4aa6188
min is 0xc4aa5d88
value_of_next0 is 0xc4aa6018
max is 0xc4aa6588
min is 0xc4aa5d88
value_of_next0 is 0xc4aa6068
max is 0xc4aa6588
min is 0xc4aa5d88
value_of_next0 is 0xc4aa6000
max is 0xc4aa6588
min is 0xc4aa5d88
value_of_next0 is 0xc4aa6000
max is 0xc4aa6588
offset_of_name_in_task is 0x188
offset_of_next_in_task is 0x4
value_of_next1 is 0xc4af3418
the buffer we read in is g_downï¿½
and proc_name2 is g_down
Now we found the offset of the next pointer of the first process is 0xc4aa6210
And the address for the first process name is: 0xc4aa6394
And the address for the second process name is: 0xc4aa6188
offset_of_name_in_task is 0x188
offset_of_next_in_task is 0x4
